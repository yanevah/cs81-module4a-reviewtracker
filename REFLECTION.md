# Reflection

## Helpful aspects of the code’s structure
The most helpful part of this code was how clearly the reading log was structured as an array of objects. Each object contained the day, book, and minutes, which made it very easy to loop through the data and perform calculations. The separation of functions, like `totalReadingMinutes` and `mostReadBook`, made the code modular and easy to follow.

## Confusing or challenging parts
The part that took the most time to understand was the `mostReadBook` function. I had to carefully trace how the loop counted each book and then how the second loop determined the maximum. Understanding how the two loops worked together to analyze the data improved my confidence with nested logic.

## What I learned
This assignment helped me see how arrays and objects work together in real code. Adding inline comments and writing function summaries made me think carefully about inputs, outputs, and program flow. Writing a test case and suggesting an improvement showed me how even small changes can make code more robust and reusable.

## Takeaways for real-world coding
In a larger project, tracking structured data like this and using modular functions would make debugging, testing, and extending code much easier. The reflection and commentary process also reinforces good coding habits and prepares me to collaborate with other developers.
